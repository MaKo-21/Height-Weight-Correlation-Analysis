# Business Statistics Seminar Project

This seminar paper for the **Business Statistics** course is based on the analysis of a dataset containing height and weight measurements of **25,000 18-year-old individuals**, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/burnoutminer/heights-and-weights-dataset).

## Descriptive Statistics

The project applies a wide range of statistical methods and visualizations to explore the dataset, including:

- Frequency tables  
- Histograms and polygons  
- Stem-and-leaf plots  
- Scatter plots  
- Measures of central tendency: mode, median, mean  
- Measures of dispersion: standard deviation, range, quartiles

## Inferential Statistics

The second part involves inferential analysis, including:

- Confidence interval estimation (90%)  
- Hypothesis testing  
- Normality testing (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)  
- Independence testing (Pearson’s chi-squared test)

## Regression Analysis

A linear regression model is built to examine the relationship between height and weight, resulting in the following regression equation:

Weight = -82.576 + 3.083 × Height

## Key Findings

- Moderate positive correlation between height and weight  
- The two variables are statistically dependent  
- The data is approximately normally distributed
